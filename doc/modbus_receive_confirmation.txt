modbus_receive_confirmation(3)
==============================


NAME
----
modbus_receive_confirmation - receive a confirmation request


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int modbus_receive_confirmation(modbus_t *'ctx', uint8_t *'rsp', int 'rsp_max');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *modbus_receive_confirmation(*_ function shall receive a request via the
socket of the context _ctx_. This function must be used for debugging purposes
because the received response isn't checked against the initial request. This
function can be used to receive request not handled by the library.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The function shall store the confirmation request in _rsp_ and return the
response length if sucessful. The returned request length can be zero if the
indication request is ignored (eg. a query for another slave in RTU
mode). Otherwise it shall return -1 and set errno.
