# Instructions to use with Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF)

## Adding libmodbus as a component

- Create a subdirectory at the top level of your ESP-IDF project where you will
place this and create a component, ie. `libmodbus`. This directory will be
referred as *component directory* further down in this text.

- Download the latest version of libmodbus with the method of your choice and
unpack it under component directory in a subdirectory `libmodbus`

- Copy the files supplied in this documentation directory to the component directory,
namely:
  - `CMakeLists.txt`: the CMake script that enumerates files and directories used
     in the build as well as defines needed dependencies
  - `component.mk`: the component build definition
  - `config.h`: the library configuration, especially tailored for ESP-IDF. This is 
    usually generated with the autoconf tool, but this is not present in ESP-IDF and
    is therefore manually prepared and customized
  - `idf_component.yml`: the component description file

- Add a reference from your main project in the project top level `CMakeLists.txt` to
  the newly added module with something like: `set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS libmodbus/)`. 
  If you already have other components you may just add the reference to the newly
  added component.

- As the ESP-IDF does not provide a `nanosleep` function in its SDK, you should add
  this in your project so you will be able to find it at linking time, for example:

```
int nanosleep(const struct timespec *req, struct timespec *_Nullable rem) {
    return usleep(req->tv_sec*1000 + req->tv_nsec / 1000);
}
```

Now you are almost ready to use libmodbus in your project!

If you desire to use the library for serial communication, you will need to do a few
more hardware configuration steps before using the `modbus_new_rtu` call, namely:

- Configure, if needed, any pins for the used uart via `uart_set_pin`

- Install the uart driver via the `uart_driver_install`

- Configure, if needed, the uart mode (ie. set it to half duplex) via `uart_set_mode`

These configurations are not included in libmodbus as they are highly hardware specific
and would require a heavy change in the library interface.

## Other details using libmodbus with ESP-IDF

- The serial driver is implemented using the `vfs` virtual filesystem component. This
  makes the changes needed for the library minimal, but may not be the most performant
  solution.

- The serial name (first parameter to `modbus_new_rtu`) should be a string containing
  only the serial index (ie. `"1"` or `"2"`).

- When using the TCP version be aware of the maximum number of sockets that can be
  open on the platform: this is by default 10 and can be possibly raised to 16 in
  a standard configuration. Please check the `LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS` configuration
  variable.
