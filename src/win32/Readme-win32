Intro
-----

This directory contains the project file for Visual
Studio 2008 to build a modbus.dll.

The project file searches for D:/include/msvc_std to
find stdint.h. See ../../README.rst

config.h and modbus-version.h were generated using
a Windows native experimental port of zsh and Microsoft cl.

Please note that modbus.dll.manifest hardcodes
the version number !



TODO
----

Fix the ugly need to have config.h and modbus-version.h
in this directory.
