Intro
-----

This directory contains the project file for Visual Studio 2008 to build a
modbus.dll.

The project file searches for D:/include/msvc_std to find stdint.h.
See ../../README.md

config.h and modbus-version.h were generated using a Windows native experimental
port of zsh and Microsoft cl.


TODO
----

Fix the ugly need to have config.h and modbus-version.h in this directory.
